For this assignment i choose cereal as the main company, I just feel that with cereal website i can put more creativity into it. I added hover effects and animation to the buttons, 
I also used iframe to attach youtube video into the website
And to make the website responsive I used some media queries, max-width 768px for tablet and 480px for smartphone.
Overall, this assignment is a fun experience help me to practice on how to make an interactive website and how to utilize media queries for responsiveness.
